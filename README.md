# FullStack Social Media App
Complete React MERN Full Stack Social Media App


A social media app  platform that allows users to connect and interact with each other through a variety of features such as posting, commenting, liking, and content. The app would be built using the MERN stack, which is a combination of four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.



Users would be able to create profiles and follow other users. The app would also include features such as a newsfeed. Users could interact with each other through commenting on posts, and liking posts.

The app's data would be stored in a MongoDB database, which would provide scalability and flexibility for handling large amounts of data. The app's user interface would be designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to access the platform from any device.
